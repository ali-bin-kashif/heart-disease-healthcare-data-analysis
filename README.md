# In-Depth Analysis of Risk Factors and Health Behaviors in the Adult Population.(End-to-End project)

This is an end-to-end data analysis project, in which we have taken a real world dataset of 2022 annual CDC survey of 400k+ adults related to their health status.

Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the world, affecting various racial groups. Nearly half of Americans have major heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicators include diabetes, obesity, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Detecting and preventing these factors is crucial in healthcare. Advances in computing, specifically machine learning, enable the identification of patterns in data to predict patient conditions. The dataset is part of the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the world's largest ongoing health survey system, conducting annual telephone surveys across all U.S. states and territories.

## Problem Statement:

The problem centers on identifying and understanding the factors that exert the most significant influence on heart disease prevalence.This exploration is crucial for healthcare initiatives and interventions aimed at prevention and management. The dataset encompasses a range of variables, including demographic information, health behaviors, chronic conditions, and COVID-19 status, providing a rich source for uncovering patterns, correlations, and disparities in cardiovascular health.

We're looking at big questions like what things make heart problems more likely, how mental and physical health are linked, what habits and steps help prevent heart issues, how other health problems affect the heart, and if issues like hearing or vision problems are connected to heart disease. We're also checking how smoking and e-cigarettes are used and how COVID-19 affects heart health.

Our main goal is to extract actionable insights from this wealth of data. We want to make plans that focus on specific things to help reduce differences in heart health and make everyone's heart healthier in the adult population.


## Key Insights:
Here are some important key findings of the whole analysis.

- **Demographic Analysis:** Females outnumber males in the sampled population, and the majority of individuals fall within the age range of 65-69 years.

- **Heart Disease Prevalence:** Most individuals did not experience heart disease, but among those who did, males comprised the majority, especially among individuals above 80 years old.

- **Behavioral Patterns:** The majority of individuals engage in physical activities, and most have never smoked in their lives. However, males show a slight lead over females in the category of current smokers.

- **Chronic Conditions:** Certain chronic conditions like arthritis, diabetes, and obesity are strongly associated with cardiovascular health disparities.

- **Mental Health Impact:** Approximately 20% of individuals are suffering from depressive disorders, and a significant portion of heart patients also have depressive disorders.

- **COVID-19:** Around one-third of the population had contracted COVID-19, with a majority not having heart disease. However, a small percentage experienced heart disease post-COVID-19 infection.

- After analyzing the dataset, we came to know that the variables which have significant effect on the likelihood of heart disease are:
  - Having Obesity.
  - Having Angina pain.
  - Having Depressive Disorder
  - Smoking
  - Having Arthritis.
  - Having Diabetes.
  - Lack of physical activity.

- Almost 50% of the population have atleast 1 major risk factor for heart disease.
